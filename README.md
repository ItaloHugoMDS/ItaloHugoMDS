### Hello there, I'm Ítalo Hugo.  

## [Programmer][0] and [Cybersecurity student][1]  

## Welcome! 👋😁

# 👾 Projects  

## 🐍 Python  

- [Extracting and parsing data in Python][2]: This is a skill showcase project where data is extracted from a log file,
parsed, sorted, and stored into a dictionary, which later is used to generate a CSV report file.  

- [Parsing images and information generating pdf report and sending emails][3]: This is a skill showcase from a prompt
exercise during the [Google IT Automation with Python][4] certificate.
(*For deeper understanding the project, check out [GitHub][3]*)  

- [Basic server health check][5]: A simple health check scan to evaluate a running server's basic components, such as
memory, storage, cpu usage, etc. In case any error is raised by the check, an email will be sent to the server's
administrator. The code is idempotent, so it can be scheduled for execution within the linux server.  

## 🖥️ Bash  

- [Updating and Upgrading in Bash][6]: A simple bash program to update and upgrade a Debian-based distro and generate an
error log in case any problem occurs during the process.  

## 🔤 C  

- [Simon Game Project][7]: This is a replication of Simon's game, it was done using a PIC microcontroller, debugged and
tested using Proteus' software simulator, and compiled using XC8 compiler running on MPLAB X. (*You can watch the
project in action by checking out the [Project's video][8]*)  

## 🔒 Cybersecurity  

- [Incident Reports][9]: This project is a skill showcase for the cybersecurity activity of reporting incidents. Prompts
with information about the incidents are provided, as well as data for the analysis, and reports were generated with all
the gathered information during the process of responding to the incident.
