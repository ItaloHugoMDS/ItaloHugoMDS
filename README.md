# 👾 Projects  

## 🐍 Python  

- [Extracting and parsing data in Python](https://github.com/ItaloHugoMDS/Extracting_and_parsing_data_in_Python):
This is a skill showcase project where data is extracted from a log file, parsed, sorted, and stored into a
dictionary, which later is used to generate a CSV file report.  

- [Parsing images and information generating pdf report and sending emails](https://github.com/ItaloHugoMDS/Parsing_images_and_information_generating_pdf_report_and_sending_emails):
This is a skill showcase from a prompt exercise during the [Google IT Automation with Python](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/certificate/SZ5MYEQC5RUK "You can also check my LinkedIn")
certificate. (*For deeper understanding the project, check out [GitHub](https://github.com/ItaloHugoMDS/Parsing_images_and_information_generating_pdf_report_and_sending_emails)*)  

- [Basic server health check](https://github.com/ItaloHugoMDS/Basic_server_health_check): A simple health check scan to
evaluate a running server's basic components, such as memory, storage, cpu usage, etc. In case any error is raised by
the check, an email will be sent to the server's administrator. The code is idempotent, so it can be scheduled for
execution within the linux server.  

## 🖥️ Bash  

- [Updating and Upgrading in Bash](https://github.com/ItaloHugoMDS/Updating_and_Upgrading_in_Bash): A simple bash
program to update and upgrade a Debian-based distro and generate an error log in case any problem occurs during the
process.  

## 🔤 C  

- [Simon-Game-Project](https://github.com/ItaloHugoMDS/Simon-Game-Project---PIC18F4520---Milford-4x20-BKP): This is a
replication of Simon's game, it was done using a PIC microcontroller, debugged and tested using Proteus' simulation
software, and compiled using XC8 compiler running on MPLAB X.
